Given an Excel file that contains financial data the goal is to create a report that shows a Profit & Loss statement and include information about the following Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s):

•	Sales for the period
•	Sales Revenue Total to Date
•	Operating Profit
•	Gross Profit
•	Net Profit
•	PBIT (Profit Before Interest & Tax)
•	EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest & Tax, Depreciation and Amortization)
•	Gross & Net Profit Margin


Also is needed to create two charts:
•	A chart that represents the relationship between Sales and Marketing Costs
•	A chart that represents the relationship between Margin, Sales and Profit


Fell free to download the files for you own research.
